          Dear Parents,
        </p>
        <p>
          Thank you for considering Montessori education for your child.
          RDreamz Montessori was conceived from my own experience as a Montessori Directress for the past 12 years. I am quite aware of the importance of balancing the needs of child, parent, and neighbouring community. To meet your family’s needs, we offer a unique, Montessori curriculum to choose from. We are integrating parent education opportunities into our enrichment centre agenda as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is a wise goal for parents to seek out the best fit between child and centre. It is equally important to be certain that a centre can realistically deliver a parent’s educational goals and personal values to a child. Learn what a Montessori school should be like, then observe the children work!
        </p>
        <p>
          In this centre of excellence, there will be trained Montessori staff who also meets our requirements. There will be a full range of Montessori materials. The children will be busy, happy, and kind. Choose carefully, as your child will be entering a second family. You should feel in harmony with centre’s ambience and practice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Trust your eyes, ears, instinct, and personal experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thank you.<br />
          Sincerely,<br />
          Ms Rekha, Montessori Directress
        </p>
